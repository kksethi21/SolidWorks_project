This project is a LEGO-style fire truck model designed in SolidWorks.

## Project Overview
- Designed a LEGO fire truck using individual mechanical parts with rotating wheels and revolving ladder
- Assembled all parts into a complete fire truck model
- Created detailed drawings directly from the 3D models

## Contents
This project includes:
- Individual part files (3D models)
- Assembly file showing the complete LEGO fire truck
- Orthographic drawing views
- Section view to illustrate internal features
- Exploded view to demonstrate assembly order and component structure

## CAD Features Used
The models were created in SolidWorks using standard features, including:
- Extrude and Cut-Extrude
- Revolve
- Fillet and Chamfer
- Linear and Circular Patterns
- Mirror
- Sketch constraints and dimensions
- Assemblies with basic mates
- Drawing views (orthographic, section, and exploded)

## Software Used
- SolidWorks

## Notes
- All geometry and dimensions are fully defined within the SolidWorks files.
- Drawings were generated directly from the 3D models.
